This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook. The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects, but if the dependency array is incorrect, it can lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior. In this case, the interval is never cleared, causing the counter to increment infinitely.  The solution provides the correct implementation with the `count` variable in the dependency array.
